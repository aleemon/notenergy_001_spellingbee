##-----  1. Overview  -----

# Provide two things in this script:
  # 1. A list of the historical puzzle questions
  # 2. A list of the historical answer sets


## Use these answer sets to compare against the Scrabble dictionary
  # There seem to be a lot of words not allowed by Spelling Bee
  # This might be more prevalent for the shorter words?


# Look online for historical answers too?


## Export data to a database

spb_090322 <- c('a','i', 't', 'r', 'c', 'o', 'm') 
spb_090322_centre <- 'm'

## Keep two lists:
  # Found answers (i.e. Scrabble answers)
  # Spelling Bee answers (the actual answers)
  # Cross compare the list over time to filter it down?


spb_090322_answers <- c()
